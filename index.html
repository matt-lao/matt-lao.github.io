                            Prospective Software Developer. Currently a Senior at the University of St. Thomas majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science and Statistics.

                            As a person who's deeply interested in both technology and the arts, I find myself in a broad world of problems to solve. Currently, I'm interning as an Software Developer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. In my free time, I enjoy audio mixing and production, along with playing the saxophone in the UST Symphonic Winds.

                            <br>
                            At St. Thomas, I had the opportunity to blend my creative and technical skills as an XR Developer, working on exciting Virtual and Augmented Reality projects for STELAR. This experience allowed me to explore the intersection of creativity and technology in a meaningful way.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Looking ahead, after college, I aspire to secure a role as a software engineer right here in Minnesota. Additionally, I have a strong desire to stay involved in music, potentially as a volunteer educator, to give back to the community that has enriched my life. Furthermore, I plan to pursue freelance audio mixing and production alongside my technology career, aiming to balance my passion for both fields.
